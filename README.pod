This is a fork of Text::AsciiTeX by Joel Berger. When I tried it, I thought the array reference returned by render was a bit awkward, so I wondered what it would be like if made it depend on context.


  use Text::AsciiArt;
 
  # scalar context
  my $text_array = render('\frac{1}{e}');
  say for @$text_array;

  # list context;
  say for render('\frac{1}{e}');

  # void context;
  render('\frac{1}{e}');
